By implementing the interactive command line, users could enter their preference and the program will provide them related options for users, including the names of restaurant and its location for a specific type of cuisine or neighborhood. 

Data source:

The root node is defined as cuisine, and child nodes of the root is the name of the cuisine. Finally, the child nodes of each restaurant are addresses. Similarly, for the neighborhood side, for the second tree, root is defined as neighborhood, and child nodes of the root are names of neighborhood, and child of the neighborhood is the corresponding restaurant.
