# SI_507_final
This program is the final project of SI 507, which is scrawling cuisine and resturants information in New York City from multiple pages of a website. By implementing the interactive command line, users could enter their preference and the program will provide them related options for users, including the names of resturant and its location for a specific type of cuisine or neighberhood. 

Data source:
https://www.nyc.com/restaurants/


User Instructions:

To get started, user will firstly be asked about any neighberhood and user need to enter either 'yes' or 'no'. Then, the program will bring the next question to allow user choose either type of cuisine or neighberhood. Finally, user could select one of the resturants and the program will return users that resturant's location.
